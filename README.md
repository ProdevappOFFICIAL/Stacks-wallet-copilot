## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Stacks wallet (Hiro, Xverse, or Leather)
- OpenRouter API key (get one at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai))

### Setup

1. **Clone and install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd stacks-chat-assistant
   npm install
   ```

2. **Configure environment variables**:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Edit `.env` and add your OpenRouter API key:

   ```env
   VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your_openrouter_api_key_here
   VITE_OPENROUTER_MODEL=meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct:free
   ```

   > **Note**: The default model `meta-llama/llama-3.2-3b-instruct:free` is cost-effective for basic operations. You can upgrade to more powerful models like `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet` for better performance.

3. **Start development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## AI-Powered Natural Language Commands

The AI assistant understands natural language and can handle various ways of expressing the same request:

### Transfer STX
```
Send 0.01 STX to ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
Transfer 5 STX to my friend's address ST...
I want to send some STX to ST1PQHQKV0RJXZFY1DGX8MNSNYVE3VGZJSRTPGZGM
Can you help me transfer 0.5 STX?
```

### Check Balance
```
What's my balance?
How much STX do I have?
Check my wallet balance
Show me my current balance
```

### Get Address
```
What's my address?
Show me my wallet address
What's my STX address?
I need my address
```

```
Show my transaction history
What are my recent transactions?

The AI will understand context and provide helpful responses even for unclear requests!

## Network Configuration

The app uses a centralized network configuration system. To switch between testnet and mainnet:

1. Open `src/utils/network.ts`
2. Change `CURRENT_NETWORK` from `'testnet'` to `'mainnet'` (or vice versa)
3. Restart your development server

```typescript
// In src/utils/network.ts
export const NETWORK_CONFIG = {
  CURRENT_NETWORK: "mainnet" as "testnet" | "mainnet", // Change this line
  // ... rest of config
};
```

**Important**: Make sure your wallet is connected to the same network as your app configuration to avoid transaction failures.

## Security

- No private keys are stored or handled by the application
- All transactions require wallet confirmation
- Transaction details are previewed before execution
- Uses official Stacks SDK methods only
