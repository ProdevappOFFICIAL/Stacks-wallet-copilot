## Network Configuration

The app uses a centralized network configuration system. To switch between testnet and mainnet:

1. Open `src/utils/network.ts`
2. Change `CURRENT_NETWORK` from `'testnet'` to `'mainnet'` (or vice versa)
3. Restart your development server

```typescript
// In src/utils/network.ts
export const NETWORK_CONFIG = {
  CURRENT_NETWORK: "mainnet" as "testnet" | "mainnet", // Change this line
  // ... rest of config
};
```

**Important**: Make sure your wallet is connected to the same network as your app configuration to avoid transaction failures.

## Security

- No private keys are stored or handled by the application
- All transactions require wallet confirmation
- Transaction details are previewed before execution
- Uses official Stacks SDK methods only
